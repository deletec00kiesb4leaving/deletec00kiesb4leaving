**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**
<h4>About Me</h4>
I'm a tech enthusiast with a renewed zeal for programming. After a four-year break, I‚Äôve dusted off my keyboard, sharpened my debugging skills, and embarked on an exciting journey back into the world of code.
<h6>The Break</h6>
For the past four years, I stepped away from programming to explore other paths. During this time, I learned valuable lessons in management, leadership, and problem-solving‚Äîskills that I now bring back to my coding endeavors.

**My goals are clear:** I want to dive deep into software development, explore machine learning, and contribute to open-source projects. I‚Äôm excited to learn new languages, frameworks, and paradigms. The thrill of solving complex problems and creating elegant software keeps me going.

Let‚Äôs write some beautiful code together!

**P.S:** I'm starting to use GitHub at the end of March'24, so from now on, you can find some projects I choose to publish here.
