## About Me? 
I've been in to computers since I was a kid and, unfortunatly (or not), I've been 4 years off and now I'm back at it!

I'm starting to use GitHub at the end of March'24, so from now on you can find some projects I choose to publish here.
### 👀 Interests:
- Privacy
- Cybersecurity
- Automations
- Reverse-Engineering
- Malware

### 👷‍♂️ Projects outside computing:
  - Freelance Photography
  - Freelance Filmmaking
  - SMMA (Meta & Google Ads)
  - Many Many Cookies 🍪🍪🍪 (expirience from being a pastry cook)
  - Wrote 3 books:
    - [2017] A book about a village and it's history (also wrote an entire website to accompany this book)
    - [2021] A book for children written and designed with AI
    - [2022] A book about productivity and team building for small companies

### Privacy Policy
- If I sent you here, it's probably because we already met, so no introductions needed.
